                            It is a tracking platform that allows users to track their vehicles in real-time. 
                            The application contains a dashboard that shows the location of the vehicle, 
                            the speed of the vehicle, and the distance traveled. The application also has a 
                            feature that allows users to set up geofencing alerts and receive notifications when 
                            the vehicle enters or exits a specific area. The application was built to show my skills in
                            NgRx, Rx.js, routing, dependency injection, data-binding, websockets, reactive forms, HttpClient for API calls
